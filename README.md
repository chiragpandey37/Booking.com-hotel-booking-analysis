# Hotel Booking Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Summary

This project focuses on conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a hotel booking dataset with the aim of deriving valuable insights to support hotel management in making well-informed decisions. The dataset encompasses a wide range of information related to hotel bookings, including booking dates, stay duration, lead time, guest demographics (including adults, children, and babies), room preferences, booking channels, cancellation rates, and revenue metrics like the average daily rate (ADR).

## Installation

To run this project, you will need Python installed on your machine along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn


You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn 
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes a wide range of information related to hotel bookings. Key attributes include:

- Booking dates
- Stay duration
- Lead time
- Guest demographics (adults, children, babies)
- Room preferences
- Booking channels
- Cancellation rates
- Revenue metrics (ADR)

## Data Preprocessing

The initial phase of the analysis involves data cleaning and preprocessing, which includes:

- Addressing missing values
  - Median for skewed data (e.g., children)
  - Mode for categorical variables (e.g., country, agent)
- Converting data types to ensure consistency
- Eliminating rows with a total guest count of zero (sum of adults, children, and babies) to maintain data quality

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Following preprocessing, various visualization techniques are employed in the EDA process:

- **Bar Plots**: Compare the frequency of bookings between city and resort hotels and assess cancellation rates for each hotel type.
- **Line Plots**: Illustrate the trend of ADR over time, segmented by hotel type.
- **Other Analyses**:
  - Booking Distribution by Month and Year: Identify peak seasons and assess the potential for implementing seasonal pricing strategies.
  - Guest Demographics Analysis: Explore the typical guest profile, enabling hotels to tailor their services more effectively.
  - Booking Lead Time Analysis: Examine how far in advance guests make bookings to adjust marketing strategies.
  - Booking Channel Performance: Evaluate the performance of various booking channels to optimize distribution strategies.
  - Cancellation Analysis: Pinpoint factors leading to cancellations and develop strategies to minimize revenue loss.
  - Room Type Preferences: Understand which room types are preferred by guests to manage room inventory more effectively.
  - Special Requests Analysis: Analyze the frequency and types of special requests to better meet guest expectations.

## Findings

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to perform an EDA on a hotel booking dataset to uncover meaningful insights and trends that can inform strategic decision-making for hotel management. The dataset includes a range of information related to hotel bookings such as booking dates, stay duration, lead time, guest demographics, room preferences, booking channels, cancellation rates, and revenue metrics.

Hotel management currently lacks a comprehensive understanding of key patterns and trends that could drive improvements in operations and guest satisfaction. Specifically, the hotel management needs to address several issues:

- Seasonality and Peak Booking Periods: Determine peak seasons and identify trends in booking frequency throughout the year to adjust pricing and marketing strategies accordingly.
- Guest Demographics: Analyze the typical guest profile to tailor services and offerings based on the composition of guests (adults, children, babies).
- Booking Lead Times: Examine how far in advance guests typically make bookings to optimize marketing efforts and inventory management.
- Booking Channel Effectiveness: Evaluate the performance of different booking channels to enhance distribution strategies and marketing focus.
- Cancellation Patterns: Identify factors contributing to booking cancellations and develop strategies to reduce their frequency and impact on revenue.
- Room Type Preferences: Understand guest preferences for different room types to improve room inventory management and pricing strategies.
- Special Requests: Analyze the types and frequency of special requests made by guests to better meet their expectations and enhance their overall experience.

## Business Objective

The primary business objective of this project is to leverage insights from the EDA of the hotel booking dataset to drive strategic improvements and operational efficiency for hotel management. Specific objectives include:

- **Optimize Pricing Strategies**: Develop dynamic pricing strategies that maximize revenue during high-demand periods and attract bookings during low-demand periods by identifying peak seasons and booking trends.
- **Enhance Guest Experience**: Utilize insights into guest demographics and special requests to tailor services and amenities, improving overall guest satisfaction and fostering repeat business.
- **Improve Marketing and Distribution**: Analyze booking lead times and channel performance to refine marketing strategies, target promotions effectively, and optimize distribution channels for better reach and conversion rates.
- **Reduce Cancellation Rates**: Investigate factors contributing to cancellations and implement measures to mitigate them, thereby minimizing revenue loss and improving booking stability.
- **Optimize Room Inventory Management**: Understand preferences for different room types to better manage room availability, pricing, and inventory, ensuring that guest needs are met efficiently.
- **Increase Revenue and Occupancy Rates**: By leveraging insights from the data, implement strategies that enhance revenue generation and increase overall occupancy rates, contributing to the financial success of the hotel.

## Conclusion

This analysis offers a comprehensive understanding of the hotel booking dataset, revealing trends and patterns that can be leveraged to enhance operational efficiency, improve guest satisfaction, and drive business success. The findings enable hotel management to make data-driven decisions that optimize occupancy rates, maximize revenue, and elevate the overall guest experience.
